        To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by the American author Harper Lee. It was published in June 1960 and became
        instantly successful. In the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools. To Kill a
        Mockingbird has become a classic of modern American literature; a year after its release, it won the Pulitzer
        Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event
        that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.

        Despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and
        humor. Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of
        integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino explains, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird
        is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the
        most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."[1] As a Southern Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary
        themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted
        that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. Lessons from
        the book emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject
        to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006,
        British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one "every adult should read before they die".
        Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use
        in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual
        impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book "an astonishing
        phenomenon". It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a
        screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's
        hometown.

        The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island,
        near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious
        millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.

        The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with socialite Ginevra King, and the riotous parties
        he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a
        rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editor Maxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise
        the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text, but remained
        ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. Painter Francis Cugat's dust jacket art,
        named Celestial Eyes, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.

        After its publication by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews, though
        some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels,
        This Side of Paradise (1920) and The Beautiful and Damned (1922), the novel was a commercial disappointment. It
        sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were
        unrealized. When the author died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.

        During World War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when the Council on Books in Wartime
        distributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas. This new-found popularity launched a critical and
        scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most American high school curricula and a part
        of American popular culture. Numerous stage and film adaptations followed in the subsequent decades.

        Gatsby continues to attract popular and scholarly attention. Scholars emphasize the novel's treatment of social
        class, inherited versus self-made wealth, gender, race, and environmentalism, and its cynical attitude towards
        the American Dream. The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary masterpiece and a contender for the
        title of the Great American Novel.

        Nineteen Eighty-Four (also published as 1984) is a dystopian novel and cautionary tale by English writer George
        Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his
        lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive
        regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[3][4] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the
        authoritarian state in the novel on the Soviet Union in the era of Stalinism and Nazi Germany.[5] More broadly,
        the novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be manipulated.

        The story takes place in an imagined future in an unspecified year believed to be 1984, when much of the world
        is in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian
        superstate Oceania, which is led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense cult of
        personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police. The Party engages in omnipresent government surveillance
        and, through the Ministry of Truth, historical negationism and constant propaganda to persecute individuality
        and independent thinking.[6]

        The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the
        Party and dreams of rebellion. Smith keeps a forbidden diary. He begins a relationship with a colleague, Julia,
        and they learn about a shadowy resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact within the
        Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith and Julia are arrested. He is subjected to months of
        psychological manipulation and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has come to love Big
        Brother.

        Nineteen Eighty-Four has become a classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction. It also
        popularised the term "Orwellian" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering common usage,
        including "Big Brother", "doublethink", "Thought Police", "thoughtcrime", "Newspeak", and "2 + 2 = 5". Parallels
        have been drawn between the novel's subject matter and real life instances of totalitarianism, mass
        surveillance, and violations of freedom of expression among other themes.[7][8][9] Orwell described his book as
        a "satire",[10] and a display of the "perversions to which a centralised economy is liable," while also stating
        he believed "that something resembling it could arrive."[10] Time included the novel on its list of the 100 best
        English-language novels published from 1923 to 2005,[11] and it was placed on the Modern Library's 100 Best
        Novels list, reaching number 13 on the editors' list and number 6 on the readers' list.[12] In 2003, it was
        listed at number eight on The Big Read survey by the BBC.
